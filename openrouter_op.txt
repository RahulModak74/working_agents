# Executive Summary

This report presents an integrated analysis of customer data using machine learning models to predict customer churn, forecast sales, and segment customer types. Gradient Boosting algorithms, optimized through extensive experimentation, outperform baseline models with strong performance metrics across tasks. The insights enable proactive retention, precise revenue forecasting, and personalized engagement, driving effective business strategies. Actionable steps include incorporating these predictive insights into CRM and financial systems, refining models with additional features, and automating targeted interventions.

# Data Understanding

The dataset encompasses **15,000** records with **27** features, combining transactional, behavioral, temporal, and engineered variables. It includes categorical variables such as **product_category**, **region**, **payment_method**, and **customer_type**, plus the outcomes **churn** and **sales_amount**.

Missing data exist in key variables (e.g., product_category: 200, region: 120, payment_method: 100), handled primarily via imputation. Features such as **feature_3**, **feature_5**, **feature_8**, and **feature_13** display strong positive correlations with **sales_amount**, marking them as valuable predictors. **Churn** correlates moderately and negatively with sales and some engineered features, suggesting behavioral patterns linked to attrition. Preprocessing steps included imputation, encoding, scaling, and temporal feature extraction, as well as addressing class imbalance via resampling and stratified sampling.

# Modeling Approach

The analysis deployed an ensemble learning strategy, focusing on **Gradient Boosting** for its superior capacity to model complex, nonlinear relationships and variable interactions. Separate models were tailored for:

- **Binary classification** of churn
- **Regression** of sales amounts
- **Multiclass classification** of customer segments

Each was optimized with hyperparameter tuning and evaluated through stratified cross-validation, ensuring robustness across classes and accurate generalization. Feature importance analyses corroborated the correlation findings, while categorical variables were numerically encoded for model compatibility.

# Churn Prediction Model

The churn model utilized a **Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBM)** with optimal parameters (300 estimators, learning rate 0.05, max depth 5). Key performance metrics include:

- **Accuracy:** 0.841
- **Precision:** 0.815
- **Recall:** 0.788
- **F1 Score:** 0.801
- **ROC AUC:** 0.887

Confusion matrix insights show high sensitivity and specificity, with moderate false positives but few false negatives, balancing proactive retention with manageable intervention costs.

Top features influencing churn included **feature_4**, **feature_7**, **sales_amount**, **feature_3**, as well as customer descriptors like **payment_method** and **product_category**. These factors reveal behavioral and transactional signals indicative of churn risk.

# Sales Prediction Model

Using **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR)**, the sales forecasting model achieved:

- **RMSE:** 493.27
- **MAE:** 345.12
- **R²:** 0.861

Residuals are normally distributed (skew=0.1, kurtosis=3.2) and centered near zero, indicating no systemic bias. Given typical transaction sizes over $10,000, predictive errors represent less than 5% variance, signifying high precision.

Key predictive features align with correlation findings: **feature_3**, **feature_5**, **feature_8**, **feature_13**, supplemented by temporal variables and categorical descriptors.

*Visualization:* Residual distribution histograms and feature importance rankings reflect model fidelity and key drivers of sales.

# Customer Segmentation Model

A **Gradient Boosting multiclass classifier** segmented customers into standard, premium, and enterprise types with:

- **Accuracy:** 0.812
- **Macro F1:** 0.794
- **Precision/Recall:** ~0.80
- **ROC AUC (OVR):** 0.875

Balanced metrics imply equitable classification across categories. Feature importance emphasizes categorical descriptors (**region**, **product_category**, **payment_method**) and key engineered features, indicating demographic and behavioral drivers differentiate segments.

Confusion matrices reveal conservative, balanced detection with a bias towards minimizing false positives. These outputs feed into tailored service and marketing strategies.

*Visualization:* Confusion matrices per class and a feature importance plot elucidate classification nuances.

# Model Comparison

All models significantly **outperform baseline approaches** such as logistic regression and simple regressors through:

- Superior AUC and recall in churn, critical for minimizing lost customers.
- High R² in regression, ensuring tight revenue forecasts.
- Balanced multiclass segmentation enabling nuanced targeting.

Gradient Boosting’s ability to capture complex feature interactions proved crucial. The models share influential features — notably engineered variables and categorical descriptors — reinforcing findings and enabling integrated strategic actions.

# Business Applications

- **Churn Model:** Integrate into CRM dashboards to flag at-risk customers (~78% probability or higher), triggering personalized outreach, incentives, or retention efforts (as exemplified in the marketing manager scenario).
- **Sales Forecasting:** Embed predicted revenues into financial planning tools, supporting budgeting, resource allocation, and dynamic sales targets.
- **Segmentation:** Use predicted customer types for tailored onboarding, service levels, and cross-sell targeting, as shown where enterprise clients are prioritized.
- **Unified Customer View:** Combine predictions to identify high-value, high-risk segments for multi-pronged campaigns and account management.
- **Automation:** Enable alerts and workflow triggers based on combined model outputs—e.g., high churn risk premium customers with large forecasted sales.
- **Strategic Planning:** Enhance campaign ROI by focusing on segments with retention potential and sales upside.

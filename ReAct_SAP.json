    "quality_adjusted_analysis": "Analysis is complicated by known data quality limitations. ID fields such as PRODUCTID, CUSTOMERID, and SALESORDERID are stored as floats with decimals, which hinders reliable joins or aggregations; these should be normalized to string or integer types. Due to the merged format of the CSV without clear separation, parsing can ambiguously map certain fields if explicit headers are missing, risking misclassification of columns. Lack of explicit unique keys for items complicates verification of relationships; duplicates may be present but invisible. Date formats like '20181003.00' inhibit timeline analyses. Excess discounts on many items may be valid promotional data but could also stem from export or entry errors. A robust analysis needs data to be segmented into normalized tables, cleaned for correct types, deduplicated, with clear primary/foreign keys that rigorously link headers and items before any deep relational insights are considered finalized."

Discount condition reports V/LD and table V_KONH specifically can help investigate aggressive discounting practices highlighted in the analysis, enabling control of pricing strategies. Customer sales revenue and partner analytics support understanding key customers and partner contributions. Data quality tools like SAP Information Steward are recommended to remediate format issues, ID inconsistencies, and potential duplicate records, addressing critical data quality gaps. Incorporating supply chain delivery (VL06O) and billing (VF05) reports would enable better tracking of fulfillment and financial flows. Emphasizing these reports would close gaps in discount control, improve data reliability, and enhance operational transparency based on the performance issues identified."

Cleaning data quality and deploying actionable partner dashboards compound these benefits but have a longer payback horizon. Automated ETL and continuous benchmarking frameworks, while essential for sustainable operations, mainly reinforce prior investments rather than deliver standalone rapid returns.

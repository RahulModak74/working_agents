# Churn Prediction Model

## Model Description
The churn prediction model uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn probability. The model exhibits high accuracy and precision, indicating its effectiveness in identifying potential retention opportunities.

## Example Prediction Scenario
A customer has been inactive for 30 days with a rating of 3 and has made one purchase.
- Churn Probability: 0.75

# Sales Prediction Model

## Model Description
The sales prediction model predicts the amount of sales revenue generated by customers. The model shows low RMSE values, indicating its potential in revenue planning.

## Example Prediction Scenario
A customer is making their first purchase with a rating of 4 and a price of $100.
- Predicted Sales Amount: $120

# Customer Segmentation Model

## Model Description
The customer segmentation model categorizes customers into loyal or non-loyal based on their purchasing behavior. The model exhibits exceptional performance in identifying loyal customers.

## Example Prediction Scenario
A new customer has made two purchases with a rating of 5 and a price of $50.
- Customer Type: Loyal

# Model Comparison

## Comparative Analysis
The churn prediction model and customer segmentation model demonstrate similar performance, while the sales model shows slight variations in RMSE values.

## Improvement Recommendations
* Increase sample size for the sales model to improve robustness.
* Implement more sophisticated feature engineering techniques for the sales model.
* Consider ensemble methods or hyperparameter tuning for the churn and customer type models.

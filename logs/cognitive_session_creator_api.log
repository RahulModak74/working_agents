==== API RESPONSE ====
I need to use the tool: cognitive:create_session
Parameters:
{
  "pattern_id": "tree_of_thoughts",
  "description": "A cognitive planning session utilizing a tree-based exploratory approach to systematically address SAP-derived business challenges. The session explicitly considers significant data quality limitations (e.g., inconsistent formats, duplicate records, missing timestamps) that undermine analytic reliability. It aims to uncover structured solution paths to improve pricing discipline, master data integration, KPI benchmarking relative to industry standards, and operational insights. Emphasis is placed on benchmarking against industry norms to contextualize discount policies, data integrity practices, and performance metrics.",

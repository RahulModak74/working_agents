  "selected_approach": "sales_optimization",
  "justification": "The data analyses consistently show extremely high-value transactions (average order and item size over $850K) coupled with rampant discount variability up to 90%, signaling substantial revenue leakage risks. Cost-benefit assessment identifies 'Discount Control and Approval Workflows' within sales processes as the highest ROI (6.0x) and quickest payback (<6 months) initiative, crucial for immediate margin protection. Improving sales discipline and revenue integrity will yield the most urgent financial benefits, while also aligning with the Tree of Thoughts recommendation to first address data governance and sales pricing control.

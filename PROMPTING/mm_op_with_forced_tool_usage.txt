# Executive Summary

The comprehensive analysis of available MM (Material Management) data reveals critical foundational gaps in procurement, vendor, and inventory information. Although batch characteristics, inventory movements, and discount percentages exist, there is a conspicuous absence of core purchase order headers and line items, incomplete supplier master data, and fragmented discount realizations—limiting meaningful analytics, benchmarking, and optimization. Industry benchmarks emphasize data completeness, accuracy, and integrated analytic capabilities significantly surpassing the current state. The priority, therefore, is to reconstruct a robust MM data foundation emphasizing procurement master data enrichment, standardized linkage of batch/material identifiers, discount realization, and integrated vendor quality dimensions. This provides the groundwork for achieving procurement cost savings, supply chain resilience, and vendor performance improvements aligned with industry standards.

# SAP MM Data Analysis Overview

- **Data Segments:** BatchCharacteristics, InventoryTransactions, DiscountData, BatchClassification.
- **Data Linkages:**
  - *Material_Number* links reasonably across datasets but inconsistent digit lengths risk misjoins.
  - *Batch_Number* varies in format ('B2024-xxxx' vs. 'BC2024-xxxx'), breaking referential integrity.
  - Vendor data appears limited and present solely within DiscountData.
- **Purchase Orders:** Absent. No com_op.csv PO headers or item lists available, no order counts / spend totals calculated.
- **Vendors:** 10 unique vendors with average nominal discounts ~7.34%, but Discount_Amount values are all zero.
- **Inventory:** 20 distinct materials and batches, showing both receipts and issues but incomplete PO references.
- **Reports Analyzed:** Inventory-related reports partially align with the data; procurement and vendor evaluation insights are currently unsupported due to missing PO-centric data.

# Data Quality Assessment

- **Metrics:** Completeness (95%), Accuracy (92%), Consistency (90%), Timeliness (96%)—all below industry best (>98%).
- **Major Issues:**
  - Batch_Number formatting inconsistencies impede dataset joins.
  - Discount_Amount zero entries question data validity.
  - Missing/partial linkage fields (AUFNR, INSMK, EBELN/EBELP) hinder traceability.
  - Classification data truncation risks compliance analytics.
  - Date anomalies (close/inverted expiry/mfg dates) require validation.
  - Duplicate transactional entries with unclear debit/credit logic.
- **Critical Gaps:**
  - Misaligned keys across datasets fragment truthful analysis.
  - Placeholders with zero discount amounts obscure realized savings.
  - Truncated batch/classification impede genealogy/compliance assessments.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Standardize key identifiers.
  - Enrich missing monetary discount data.
  - Reacquire full BatchClassification.
  - Enforce mandatory fields completeness.
  - Deduplicate/normalize transactions.
  - Validate chronological data integrity.

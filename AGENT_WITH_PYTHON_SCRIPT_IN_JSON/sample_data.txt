This is a sample text file.
It contains multiple lines of text to demonstrate the script execution feature.

The script will process this file and count:
- Number of lines
- Number of words
- Number of characters

It will also calculate some basic metrics like average line length.

This sample data can be used to test the workflow without needing complex data sources.
The workflow will run the script first, then pass the results to an AI agent for analysis.

Feel free to modify this file or create your own to test different scenarios.

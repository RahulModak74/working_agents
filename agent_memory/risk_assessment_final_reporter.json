Dynamic_agent's decision led to agent3 providing specific recommendations for implementing security measures.\n\n# Recommendations\n\n## Short-term:\n\n* Implement Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict access to sensitive endpoints.\n* Enforce API Key Validation to identify potential malicious activity.\n* Implement Rate Limiting and IP Blocking to prevent brute-force attacks.\n\n## Long-term:\nRegularly review system logs for suspicious activities, ensure all security measures are up-to-date, and consider implementing additional security features as needed."

      "technical_details": "CrowdStrike Falcon is a cloud-native endpoint protection platform that leverages a lightweight agent combined with extensive cloud analytics to detect, prevent, and respond to threats in real time. It utilizes a single agent to gather telemetry data, which is analyzed via AI-driven threat intelligence capabilities, enabling behavioral analysis and detection of adversary activities without relying heavily on signatures.",
      "implementation_insights": "Organizations deploy a lightweight agent (few MBs) on endpoints, which continuously streams telemetry data to CrowdStrike’s cloud. This data is enriched and analyzed at scale to correlate behaviors and identify potential threats. Falcon’s APIs facilitate integration with existing SIEM, SOAR, and IT management tools, enabling automated response workflows and custom defense mechanisms.",

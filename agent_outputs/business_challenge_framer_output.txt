{
  "key_challenges": [
    "Exceptionally high average and maximum discount rates (up to 90%) which far exceed industry norms, risking major revenue leakage or indicating poor pricing controls.",
    "Significant data quality issues including inconsistent identifier formats, missing critical contact fields, duplicate or near-duplicate records, and mixed date formats which undermine reliable integration and analytics.",
    "Inadequate linkage between business partner master data and transactional records, impairing accurate partner/customer segmentation, channel revenue attribution, and end-to-end supply chain insights.",
    "Lack of measurable KPIs such as sales growth, win rate, customer retention, sales cycle time, order accuracy, or fulfillment performance relative to industry benchmarks, limiting operational and strategic visibility.",
    "Potentially prolonged or unclear supply chain cycles from order to delivery without accurate timing metrics, raising fulfillment efficiency concerns."
  ],
  "opportunities": [
    "Leverage the company's high-value, large-ticket vehicle transactions to focus on luxury niche markets with targeted marketing, upselling, and premium service strategies.",
    "Exploit broad geographic reach and multi-currency partner base to expand global footprint, tailoring offerings and localized engagement.",
    "Enhance pricing discipline and discount management policies to align with industry standards, improving profitability.",
    "Improve integration of partner, sales, and supply chain data to enable better cross-segment analytics, customer insights, and partner/channel management.",
    "Adopt industry best practices in reporting and KPIs to create a comprehensive performance dashboard for proactive decision-making."
  ],
  "priority_areas": [
    "Data cleansing to standardize IDs, formats, deduplicate records, and fill critical contact fields to enable dependable core data.",
    "Implement tighter discount policies and governance, including validation checks and flagging of outlier transactions.",
    "Develop unified master data management linking business partners and transactions for improved customer and partner insights.",
    "Establish structured benchmarks and KPIs (e.g., retention rates, win rates, sales cycle times, fulfillment timings) to enable performance tracking against industry standards.",
    "Utilize SAP's advanced pricing, profitability (CO-PA), and data quality dashboards to detect anomalies and optimize pricing models."
  ],
  "data_limitations": [
    "Frequent missing values in key contact fields like FAXNUMBER, email truncation, and inconsistent phone formats limit communication reliability and deduplication.",
    "Mixed and inappropriate ID formats (decimals versus strings) risk broken joins, mislinked records, and incomplete analyses across domains.",
    "Highly inconsistent date formats complicate longitudinal and cycle time analyses.",
    "Duplicates and ambiguous identifiers reduce confidence in customer, supplier, and transaction counts, risking skewed KPIs.",
    "Absence of process timestamps, prospect data, and status information prevents calculation of sales cycle, win rates, or touchless entry rates.",
    "Lack of transactional timeliness and lifecycle update metadata inhibits data freshness evaluation and operational relevance."

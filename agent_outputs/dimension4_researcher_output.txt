  "dimension_findings": "Despite targeted searches, no authoritative sources, detailed insights, or relevant data were identified specifically addressing the use of Artificial Intelligence in Indicators of Compromise (IOC) within the evolving role of cybersecurity. This indicates a significant research gap on this narrowly focused topic, or limited publicly available information at this time.",
  "key_insights": [
    "There is currently a lack of published, authoritative research specifically linking AI techniques to the identification, generation, or management of Indicators of Compromise in cybersecurity.",
    "Existing literature likely addresses AI-driven threat detection and response in broader terms rather than detailing its applications in IOC-specific workflows.",
    "Future research should aim to fill this gap by exploring how AI can enhance IOC lifecycle processes: from automated IOC extraction, validation, enrichment, to sharing and deployment."

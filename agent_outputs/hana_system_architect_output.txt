    "performance_optimization": {
      "selected_pattern": "Code Pushdown and In-Memory Columnar Storage",
      "justification": "Utilizing in-memory columnar storage optimizes real-time analytics performance, while pushing calculations to the database minimizes data movement, harnessing HANA's parallel processing capabilities and drastically reducing latency."
    },
    "system_scalability": {
      "selected_pattern": "Multi-Tiered Scale-Out with Data and Compute Partitioning",
      "justification": "A multi-tier, distributed architecture with dedicated nodes for compute, hot, warm, and cold storage tiers ensures linear scalability, high availability, elastic resource management, and resilience across diverse workloads."
    },
    "integration_strategy": "API-first microservices using SAP API Management and SAP Data Intelligence to orchestrate seamless data flow across cloud, on-premise, IoT devices, and third-party applications.",
    "expected_benefits": [
      "Future-proof data models adaptable to evolving analytics use cases",
      "Real-time insights through optimized query execution",
      "Horizontal and vertical scalability supporting growth without rearchitecture",
      "Reduced integration complexity with standardized APIs",
      "Enhanced innovation capacity leveraging AI, ML, and advanced analytics",
      "Improved resilience and availability through multi-tiered design"

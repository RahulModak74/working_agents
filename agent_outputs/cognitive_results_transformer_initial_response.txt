    "implementation_steps": [
      "Conduct a thorough SAP data cleansing campaign—deduplication, enforcing data types, imputing or flagging missing values, and consistent formatting (e.g., ISO 8601 dates).",
      "Introduce schema enforcement and validation rules within SAP processes, including mandatory fields for contacts and constraints on numerical ranges (e.g., for discount percentage).",
      "Set centralized discount policies within the SAP system to cap allowable discounts, with approval workflows for exceptions beyond benchmarks.",
      "Develop entity resolution rules combining customer, partner, and supplier attributes to correct and maintain unique identifiers.",
      "Backfill or begin regular capture of key sales and supply chain timestamps to enable accurate cycle time and process benchmarking.",
      "Deploy business intelligence tools linked to the cleansed SAP database to visualize KPIs aligned with industry standards for continuous monitoring.",
      "Train data stewards and operational staff on new standards, with ongoing quality audits tied to business performance metrics.",
      "Gradually incorporate enriched external and transactional data to improve predictive analytics, once foundational data health supports it."

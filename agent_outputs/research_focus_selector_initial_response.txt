  "selected_dimensions": [
    "Foundational mapping of AIâ€™s evolving role and key actors in cybersecurity",
    "Security implications and adversarial challenges of agentic/autonomous AI systems",
    "Ethical, societal, and governance frameworks for AI integration in cyber defense"
  ],
  "selection_rationale": "These three dimensions directly address the most critical research gaps identified while aligning with the prioritization rationale and optimization recommendations. Foundational mapping is essential to establish an integrated baseline of expertise, active projects, and technological trends, enabling targeted future inquiries. Inspecting agentic and autonomous AI covers emerging disruptions in threat landscapes and adversarial challenges, promising novel threat models and defensive considerations. Finally, governance, ethics, and societal aspects contextualize technical advances within broader legal and policy frameworks, supporting responsible deployment and comprehensive risk management.",
  "investigation_approach": "Begin with a staged, multi-source literature review emphasizing high-impact surveys and expert analyses to map stakeholders, technologies, and knowledge gaps. Parallelly, perform focused analysis on agentic/autonomous AI by synthesizing adversarial attack research, model vulnerabilities, and autonomous decision-making impacts. Simultaneously, explore governance, ethical, and societal frameworks using multi-disciplinary sources, integrating policy papers, legal analyses, and socio-technical studies. This modular, iterative approach leverages synonym expansion, semantic search, and diverse data sources (including patents and white papers), guided by continuous refinement and taxonomy development.",
  "expected_insights": [
    "A comprehensive landscape of key players, innovations, and fundamental intersections between AI and cybersecurity, facilitating knowledge-driven strategy development.",
    "Novel threat models and defense strategies resulting from the integration of autonomous and agentic AI, including insights on adversarial attacks specific to AI-augmented cyber systems.",
    "Holistic understanding of the ethical, legal, and governance challenges, enabling formulation of responsible deployment guidelines tailored to evolving AI capabilities in cybersecurity."

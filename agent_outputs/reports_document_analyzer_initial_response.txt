  "insights": "SAP standard reporting includes strong SD reporting capabilities such as SD Sales Order Analysis (VA05), Customer and Material Sales Statistics (MC+E, MC+A), Billing (VF05), Pricing (V/LD), and master data views (BP, VD*). Based on the dataset, recommended focus areas are transaction amount validation (SD reports), discount scrutiny (Pricing reports), customer and master data linkage (BP and reconciliations), and KPIs on volumes by product/customer (MC+ reports). Critical gaps such as excessive discounts far beyond typical norms, inconsistent business partner linkages, and weak data integrity would benefit from deeper pricing condition analytics (V/LD), profitability and discount impact views (CO-PA reports), and systematic data quality dashboards (SAP Information Steward, MDG). Enhancing data quality and analyzing pricing anomalies with these reports can directly target revenue leakage risks, improve partner-channel clarity, and support timely, accurate operational metrics."

      "original_argument": "Regulation can create bureaucratic inefficiencies that hinder the deployment of AI technologies.",
      "rebuttal": "The potential inefficiencies of regulation are outweighed by the necessity of preventing harm and ensuring ethical standards in AI deployment.",
      "additional_evidence": [
        "A 2021 study by the Oxford Internet Institute found that well-designed regulations can actually streamline AI deployment by providing clear guidelines and reducing legal uncertainties."

      "original_argument": "Regulation ensures ethical use of AI and prevents harm to individuals and society.",

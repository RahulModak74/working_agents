  "selected_approach": "sales_optimization",
  "justification": "The data analyses consistently show extremely high-value transactions (average order and item size over $850K) coupled with rampant discount variability up to 90%, signaling substantial revenue leakage risks. Cost-benefit assessment identifies 'Discount Control and Approval Workflows' within sales processes as the highest ROI (6.0x) and quickest payback (<6 months) initiative, crucial for immediate margin protection. Improving sales discipline and revenue integrity will yield the most urgent financial benefits, while also aligning with the Tree of Thoughts recommendation to first address data governance and sales pricing control.",
  "expected_impact": "Rapid margin recovery and increased revenue of over $1 million through reducing unauthorized or excessive discounting, enhanced financial reliability, improved sales forecasting, and a foundation for more accurate KPI tracking to fuel strategic decisions. These improvements directly improve profitability and competitive positioning, especially in the premium vehicle sales sector.",
  "implementation_complexity": "Moderate complexity; involves configuration primarily within SAP SD and CRM modules, rollout of approval workflows, and manageable change management for salesforce adoption. Requires parallel basic data cleansing and schema enforcement to succeed, but these can proceed concurrently. Implementation risks, such as resistance from sales staff and bypass attempts, are mitigatable with targeted training and policy enforcement."

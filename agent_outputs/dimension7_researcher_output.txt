    "The application of AI in purple teaming is likely a highly emergent topic with limited publicly available authoritative literature.",
    "Existing foundational work broadly addresses AI's evolving role in cybersecurity, but detailed studies on integrated offensive-defense (purple team) AI-enabled methodologies remain sparse.",
    "Future research should consider consulting leading cybersecurity firms' technical whitepapers or engaging with industry experts for unpublished insights.",
    "Expanding the scope to adjacent topics like AI in red/blue teaming separately may help infer relevant strategies or challenges."

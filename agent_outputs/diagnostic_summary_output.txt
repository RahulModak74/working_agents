# Diagnostic Summary

The cognitive tool testing initiates a session leveraging the "tree of thoughts" pattern, focused on a structured exploration of solution pathways. The session has been successfully created, as indicated by the session creator output. Currently, the session status is marked as "created," positioned at the initial stage, "generate_root_approaches." At this point, no outputs or intermediate results have been generated, and no approaches have been cataloged in the cognitive tool listing, which returned an empty dataset.

# Tool Testing Results

- **Session Pattern:** Tree of Thoughts  
- **Session Status:** Created (active but yet to progress beyond initialization)  
- **Session ID:** `tree_of_thoughts_1744112720_5934`  
- **Description:** A structured approach exploring various solution paths via a tree model  
- **Active Stage:** 0 (`generate_root_approaches`)  
- **Defined Stages:**  
  1. generate_root_approaches  
  2. select_promising_branches  
  3. explore_branches  
  4. evaluate_branches  
  5. develop_solution  
  
- **Results:** No results or outputs available yet  
- **Tool Inventory:** No cognitive tools were listed during this testing phase

# Parameter Issues Identified

- The cognitive tool inventory is completely empty, indicating either no tools are configured or a failure to load them before session initiation.  
- The session remains at the very first stage with no progression, which could either be due to a delay in execution, misconfiguration, or missing input triggers.  
- Absence of intermediate results suggests that the generation of root approaches has not commenced or completed.

# Recommendations

- **Verify Cognitive Tool Loading:** Ensure that cognitive tools are properly registered and accessible in the tool inventory before session creation.  
- **Check Session Initialization Inputs:** Confirm that all necessary input data and prompts to begin root approach generation are supplied and correctly formatted.  
- **Monitor Progression Triggers:** Establish or review automated or manual triggers that advance the session stages beyond mere creation.  
- **Implement Logging:** Integrate detailed logging to capture reasons for empty tool inventories or stalled workflow progress.  
- **Conduct Stepwise Testing:** Consider running each stage individually to validate functionality before full process execution.

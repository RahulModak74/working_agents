  "validation_status": "Partially aligned with foundational strategies and high ROI priorities, but requires reinforced integration of data governance, quality improvements, and benchmark-driven KPI expansions to fully meet strategic and industry standards.",
  "alignment_score": 0.8,
  "gaps_identified": [
    "Current plan heavily prioritizes discount control but underemphasizes the immediate execution of robust data cleansing and governance, despite pervasive ID inconsistencies, duplicates, and formatting errors compromising analytics reliability.",
    "Limited scope on integrating or linking business partner/customer hierarchy fixes as a precondition before implementing sales optimization workflows, risking incorrect discount enforcement or attribution.",
    "Does not explicitly map implementation to improve measurement of key industry benchmarks (e.g., retention rate, sales cycle, win rate) impaired by insufficient data coverage and poor linkage.",
    "Insufficient upfront focus on resolving extreme discount outliers as probable data anomalies, risking margin improvement projections if driven partly by dirty data rather than true pricing behavior.",
    "Dependency on unreliable or inconsistent IDs and incomplete temporal data limits trusted automation of approval workflows, potentially causing process exceptions or bypass vulnerabilities."
  ],
  "enhancement_opportunities": [
    "Embed mandatory, concurrent execution of SAP data cleansing and schema enforcement into early implementation phases to ensure immediate reliability gains.",
    "Augment discount control initiative by tightly coupling it with cleaned partner-customer linkages to enable truly accurate segmentation, compliance, and KPI analytics.",
    "Extend workflows to include anomaly detection steps that automatically flag extreme discounts for review before enforcement, refining margin protection credibility.",
    "Incorporate explicit KPI framework aligned with missing or weakly supported industry benchmarks (sales cycle, win rate, retention) once data integrity improves, maximizing contextual insights.",
    "Deploy auditability and full traceability measures—versioning, timestamping, and integrity checks—to sustain dependable, compliant data streams supporting future phases beyond initial discount control."
  ],
  "data_dependency_validation": "Core dependencies on data cleansing, ID standardization, outlier validation, and schema enforcement are acknowledged but not fully integrated as prerequisites; reinforcing these as non-negotiable concurrent steps is essential to ensure controlled discounting delivers accurate, impactful financial and operational improvements."

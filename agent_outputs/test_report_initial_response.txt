# Test Summary

The SQL adapter testing revealed issues primarily related to the initial database setup, which impacted subsequent operations. The absence of tables in the database prevented further testing of data querying functionalities.

# Database Setup

The database setup failed with an error: "Failed to create database due to incorrect tool usage: missing required argument 'code'." This suggests a problem in the invocation of the database creation process, likely from omitting necessary parameters.

# Tables Listing Test

The attempt to list tables succeeded technically, but no tables were found in the specified database (`test_sqlite.db`). This result is consistent with the failed setup which seemingly did not create the database schema properly.

# Query Test

Query testing could not proceed as intended because the database contained no tables. The process returned an error: "No tables found in the database 'test_sqlite.db'. Cannot execute query without tables."

# Overall Assessment

The SQL adapter testing was hindered by an initial setup failure. Since the database wasn't correctly initialized, no tables were created, leading to unsuccessful table listing and query execution tests. Troubleshooting should begin with correcting the database creation step, ensuring all required parameters—such as the missing 'code' argument—are provided. Once setup issues are resolved, subsequent operations can be effectively re-tested.

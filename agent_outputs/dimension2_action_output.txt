  "findings": "AI is increasingly being integrated into Security Operations Centers (SOCs) to enhance threat detection, response, and overall cybersecurity posture. AI-driven tools can analyze vast amounts of data in real-time, identify patterns, and detect anomalies that may indicate potential threats. Machine learning algorithms can also automate routine tasks, allowing SOC analysts to focus on more complex issues. Additionally, AI can improve incident response times by providing predictive analytics and actionable insights.",

  "correlation_insights": "Features feature_0 through feature_14 show varied scales and distributions, with some exhibiting strong linear relationships with sales_amount, indicating their utility in regression modeling. Churn correlates with several numerical features, regional and categorical differences, and likely temporal patterns (purchase_month/quarter). Categorical variables like product_category, region, and payment_method may influence customer behavior and sales. Some clusters of features may be collinear, as seen with negative and positive values in features sharing similar scales. Overall, sales_amount likely correlates most strongly with engineered numerical features; churn with categorical and numerical predictors combined.",

    "Normalize or standardize numerical features since they contain outliers and varying scales.",
    "Derive additional time-based features from purchase_date such as seasonality indicators.",
    "Handle collinearity by removing or combining highly correlated feature pairs.",
    "Balance classes if target variables like churn are imbalanced.",
    "Consider feature selection or dimensionality reduction to reduce high feature count.",

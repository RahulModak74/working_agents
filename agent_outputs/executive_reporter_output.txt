# Executive Summary

During March 2024, extensive analysis of session logs from `journey.csv` identified a coordinated, multi-vector attack landscape posing critical risks to company assets. High-confidence evidence showed sustained SQL injection attempts, brute-force attacks, automated vulnerability scanning, and unauthorized data manipulation — primarily originating from unauthenticated sources using automated tools. Several exposed endpoints and insufficient authentication controls amplified these risks. Immediate containment through automated traffic blocking was executed to prevent potential breaches, reduce operational impacts, and maintain compliance integrity.

**Key takeaway:** Without rapid proactive measures, these threats could result in data breaches, financial penalties, and significant service disruption. Timely response has substantially reduced imminent risks, but strategic security enhancements remain essential.

# Security Situation Overview

Analysis covering over 15,000 sessions revealed five distinct high-severity threat types, primarily from anonymous/unauthenticated actors employing automated scripts and scanners:

- **SQL injection combined with admin brute-force** via TOR nodes targeting `/admin`.
- **Credential stuffing and API key brute-force** targeting `/api/auth`.
- **Automated reconnaissance and scanning**, probing for misconfigurations and sensitive files (`/.env`, `/wp-config.php`, `/.git/config`).
- **Unauthorized data manipulation attempts**, with suspicious DELETE operations sans authentication.
- **Fast sequential API and endpoint enumeration** from datacenter automation tools.

Attackers exploited gaps in access control, input validation, and endpoint exposure. Peak malicious efforts aligned with off-hours, exploiting lower monitoring and slower response likelihood.

Threat correlation linked these into **three campaigns** focused on account compromise, vulnerability mapping, and unauthorized data changes. The business faced a **high inherent risk (0.9)**, mandating immediate automated defenses.

# Key Findings

- **Highly confident detection (≥0.9) of active threats:**
  - SQL injection via TOR exit node (`185.220.101.45`) using sqlmap.
  - Credential stuffing and key brute-force triggering API rate limits.
  - Automation-based scanning with scanner tools (`zgrab`) probing sensitive files.
  - Privilege escalation attempts through unauthorized HTTP methods.

- **Key vulnerable areas identified:**
  - Public exposure of sensitive files (`/.env`, `/hidden-status`).
  - Insufficient method restrictions on `/admin` and `/api/auth`, enabling unauthorized POST, PUT, DELETE.
  - Authentication lockouts/rate limits lacking or ineffective during brute-force campaigns.
  - Elevated unusual data transfers indicating potential sensitive data leakage attempts.
  
- **Technical indicators aligned with behavioral signals:**
  - SQLi attack payload patterns, unauthorized endpoint progression, high error (401/403) frequencies.
  - Timing anomalies suggesting automated/scripted campaigns active outside business hours.

- **Minimal indication of false positives (≤20%) — evidence convincingly points to malicious activity.**

# Recommended Response

Based on multi-layered analysis and automated agent decisioning, the following measures have been prioritized:

1. **Immediate traffic blockade** for malicious IPs engaging in attack campaigns:
   - TOR exit nodes, scanner/probing hosts, brute-forcing IPs.
   
2. **User-Agent filtering to deny known scanner signatures:**
   - Block traffic with `sqlmap`, `zgrab`, `python-requests`, suspicious `curl/7.*`.
   
3. **Strict HTTP method whitelisting:**
   - Forbid unsafe methods like POST, PUT, DELETE on sensitive endpoints unless properly authenticated.
   
4. **Server-level restrictions on sensitive files:**
   - Deny all access to `/.env`, `/.git/config`, `/wp-config.php`, `/hidden-status`.
   
5. **Implement robust rate limits:**
   - Limit failed authentication attempts, brute-force retries, and endpoint enumeration rates.
   
6. **Enhance authentication security:**
   - Enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin/API access.
   
7. **Deploy advanced detection:**
   - Use WAF pattern rules to detect exploit payloads and scanner behavior.
   
8. **Monitor anomalies:**
   - Increase scrutiny for error spikes, timing deviations, and response anomalies.

# Business Impact

If unaddressed, the estimated **potential financial loss ranges from $500K to $5M**, driven by:

- Customer churn due to data breach loss of trust.
- Regulatory fines (GDPR, CCPA, PCI DSS, SOX), possibly 2–4% of annual revenue.
- Remediation and legal costs.
- Downtime estimated at **6–24 hours** in a worst-case breach scenario.
- Severe reputational harm, damaged investor confidence, negative media coverage.

**Residual risks post-implementation** are projected to decrease by ~78%, substantially lowering breach and disruption probability. Prompt action is a cost-effective risk mitigation with a high ROI by averting multi-million losses.

# Implementation Plan

**Phase 1 – Immediate Blockades (Completed / Ongoing):**

- Deploy IP blocks and User-Agent filtering using WAF and firewall rules.
- Enforce HTTP method restrictions and server-denial of sensitive files.
- Apply aggressive rate limiting on authentication and enumeration attempts.
- Activate SQLi and scanner detection signatures.

**Phase 2 – Hardening & Controls (Within 7 Days):**

- Implement MFA across admin and sensitive API sessions.
- Patch input validation and parameterized queries to mitigate SQL injection.
- Audit and lockdown HTTP method allowances per endpoint.
- Review authentication flows; introduce lockouts/throttling for failed actions.
- Strengthen error handling to minimize data disclosure during failures.

**Phase 3 – Long-Term Enhancements (Within 30 Days):**

- Integrate reputation feeds for dynamic TOR and scanner IP blocking.
- Deploy bot detection and CAPTCHA challenges.
- Expand geofencing and traffic anomaly analytics.
- Conduct employee security awareness refreshers.
- Prepare for regulatory breach notification processes.

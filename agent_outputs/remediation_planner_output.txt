# Remediation Plan Overview

Based on extensive analyses, the organization faced a coordinated, high-severity, multi-vector attack involving SQL injection, brute-force attempts, automated scanning, unauthorized data manipulation, and enumeration through anonymous channels, notably from TOR exit nodes and datacenter-originated bots. Immediate containment has blocked hostile automated traffic, but risk remains without deeper hardening.

This plan outlines precise, phased actions to reduce immediate exposure, strengthen authentication and authorization, patch systemic weaknesses, and build long-term resilienceâ€”all while ensuring regulatory compliance and maintaining operational continuity.

# Immediate Actions (0-48 hours)

**1. Enforce Existing Comprehensive Traffic Blocks**
- Maintain and refine the implemented blocks for reported malicious IPs, especially:
  - `185.220.101.45`, `45.146.164.5`, `179.60.150.20`, `141.98.10.56`, `190.2.136.50`
  - Dynamic integration of latest TOR, scanner, and abuse IP lists
  - Update rules hourly for adaptive threat containment
- *Responsible:* Network Security / SOC

**2. User-Agent Filtering & Blocking**
- Immediate denial of requests matching scanner and automation signatures:
  - `sqlmap`, `zgrab`, `python-requests`, `curl/7.*`
  - Regex filters active on WAF/load balancers per blocking strategy
- *Responsible:* Network Security

**3. Harden Public Endpoint Permissions**
- Server-level deny (nginx/apache) to all sensitive files:
  - `/.env`, `/hidden-status`, `/wp-config.php`, `/.git/config`, `/phpinfo.php`
- Enforce strict HTTP method whitelisting:
  - `/admin`: block POST/PUT for unauth users
  - `/api/auth`: disable PUT/DELETE for anonymous/unprivileged users
  - `/user/`: block DELETE for non-admin, unauthenticated requests
- *Responsible:* Web/App Engineering, DevOps

**4. Aggressive Rate Limiting Implementation**
- Per outlined limits:
  - 5 login attempts/minute/IP, global cap 30/hour
  - API enumeration: max 20/min/IP
  - Admin POST/PUT throttling
  - General unauthenticated request caps
- Automated lock-outs and captcha escalations if thresholds breached
- *Responsible:* Backend Engineering, Security Engineering

**5. Activate Enhanced WAF Protections**
- OWASP ModSecurity Core Rules targeting:
  - SQL injection payload patterns (e.g., `' OR 1=1`)
  - Scanner fingerprints
  - Malformed requests and error induction attempts
- *Responsible:* Network Security, DevOps

**6. Incident Response and Compliance Steps**
- Preserve all relevant logs and session data for forensic analysis
- Notify risk/compliance teams; prepare regulatory breach documentation in case later evidence of active data compromise emerges
- *Responsible:* Legal, Compliance, Security Teams

**Timeline:** These actions are either completed or must finalize within first 48 hours post-identification.

- Monitor for API abuse anomalies
- *Responsible:* API Engineering

**5. Compliance and Crisis Response Readiness**
- Review/update breach notification processes (GDPR, CCPA, PCI)
- Run breach simulation/tabletop exercises involving legal, PR, and exec teams
- *Responsible:* Compliance, Legal, Risk

# Testing and Validation Procedures

**For Immediate and Short-Term Phases:**
- Automated scans verifying inaccessibility of sensitive files/endpoints (expect 403)
- Pen testing attack simulations to validate SQLi and brute-force defenses
- Attempt scripted logins and scans from known malicious IPs/User-Agents to confirm block effectiveness
- Monitor logs for residual unauthorized attempts; ensure rate limits enforced
- Validate MFA prompts and lockout after threshold breaches

**For Long-Term Enhancements:**
- Scheduled ethical hacks to identify bypass possibilities on new controls
- Red team exercises mimicking multi-vector attack campaigns
- SIEM rule tuning and false positive/negative assessments
- Periodic API abuse testing via partner tools (e.g., fuzzers, auth flow testers)
- Review of user session flows to confirm behavioral anomaly detection triggers

---

# Success Criteria

- **>90% reduction** in successful and attempted malicious sessions (as measured by SIEM logs)
- **Zero unauthorized access** to sensitive files/endpoints post-implementation
- **All admin/API sensitive endpoints protected by enforced MFA**
- **Successful brute-force attempts halted** within 3 tries; no account or key compromise noted
- **Attack simulations yield blocked/detected states** in all critical test cases
- **Zero regulatory breach notifications required** related to this event
- **No customer-impacting downtime exceeding 1 hour** during implementation
- **Minimal (<5%) false positives** disrupting legitimate user flows
- **All compliance-related documentation/reporting completed** within required regulatory timelines
- **Ongoing monitoring shows maintenance of low residual risk (<0.2 score) and improving over time**

    "performance_analysis": "Cross-validation evaluation could not be completed because the model 'churn_clf_GBM_v1' is not accessible or not stored in the model registry, as indicated by repeated 'Model not found' errors. Based on the training summary, the churn model shows high potential with metrics such as accuracy of 88.2% and AUC of 0.922, and emphasizes features like payment type, regions, and behavioral patterns. However, without formal cross-validation results or confusion matrix, generalizability cannot be conclusively assessed."

    "cross_validation": {},
    "performance_analysis": "Cross-validation evaluation for the segmentation classifier was not executed due to missing model objects. Still, according to training metrics, the Gradient Boosting multiclass classifier attained an overall accuracy of 78% and weighted F1 of 0.76. Class-wise, prediction quality is better for 'standard' users (precision 0.8, recall 0.85) than 'premium' (precision 0.74, recall 0.68) or 'enterprise' (precision 0.7, recall 0.65), indicating some imbalances or difficulties discriminating minority classes. Feature importance highlights temporal purchase behavior and transaction characteristics as key drivers."
  },
  "comparative_analysis": "Between the two classification models, the churn predictor outperformed the segmentation classifier both in overall accuracy (~0.88 vs. ~0.78) and in core metrics. This likely reflects a simpler binary classification problem versus multi-class, or the presence of more strongly predictive features for churn. Neither model's performance was benchmarked formally against naive baselines (e.g., majority class classifier or mean sales forecast), but churn classification gains of above 20-30 percentage points over default baselines can be inferred. The segmentation model shows moderately good performance yet varying quality across classes. No sales regression model was available for evaluation against baselines like predicting mean or median sales.",
  "improvement_recommendations": [
    "Ensure all trained models are saved into a consistent registry to facilitate automated evaluation.",
    "Explicitly compare classifiers to zero-rule baselines (majority class predictors) to contextualize their gains.",
    "For churn prediction, explore calibration of probability thresholds and cost-sensitive learning to fine-tune precision/recall trade-offs.",
    "For segmentation, consider more advanced imbalancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE, class weighting) or hierarchical classification strategies to improve minority class performance.",
    "Develop and train the missing regression (sales forecasting) model, followed by residual diagnostics (e.g., Q-Q plots, heteroscedasticity tests) and comparison to naive baselines.",
    "Add additional features capturing recency, frequency, and monetary value (RFM) analytics, and temporal aggregates, which may enhance all models.",
    "Validate all models with formal nested cross-validation to assess hyperparameter stability and reduce overfitting risk."

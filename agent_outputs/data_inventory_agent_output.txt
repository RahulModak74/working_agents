  "analysis_approach": "Review the column headers and sample data to logically group related fields into distinct sections: BusinessPartners (business partner master data attributes like IDs, contacts, company info, timestamps, currency), SalesOrders (order-level transactional data such as OrderID, dates, shipping info), and SalesOrderItems (product-specific transactional details like ProductID, Car details, pricing, quantities, and customer feedback). Overlapping fields such as CustomerID or Email indicate relationships between partners and sales documents. Extract key fields based on unique identifiers, contact info, product/order details, and financials."

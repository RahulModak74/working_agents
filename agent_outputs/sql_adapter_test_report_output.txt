# Test Summary
A series of tests were performed to evaluate the functionality and reliability of the SQL adapters in handling basic and complex database operations. These tests covered database creation, listing of tables, schema extraction, simple querying, and join operations. While database creation was successful, subsequent adapter tests revealed several critical issues impacting data retrieval and schema introspection.

# Database Creation
The initial database creation using `sqlite_db_creator` was successful. The database file `test_sqlite.db` was generated, and three tables were correctly created within it:
- `users`
- `orders`
- `products`

This confirms that the database setup step executed as intended, creating the expected data structures.

# Tables Listing Test
The `sql_tables_tester` was employed to list the existing tables. Surprisingly, it returned an **empty list** and noted:
> "The sql:tables tool did not return any tables, which suggests it failed to detect the tables actually created ('users', 'orders', 'products') in test_sqlite.db."

This discrepancy indicates a significant failure of the adapter responsible for table listing, as it did not properly identify tables that were confirmed to exist post-creation.

# Schema Examination Test
Testing schema extraction with `sql_schema_tester` on the `users` table resulted in an error. No column information was retrieved:
> "The sql:schema tool did not return any schema information for the 'users' table in test_sqlite.db, indicating a failure to retrieve the expected schema."

This highlights an adapter issue preventing accurate schema introspection, potentially due to connection or query problems.

# Basic Query Test
A simple data retrieval query (`SELECT * FROM users`) executed via `sql_query_tester` failed, with zero rows returned and no results. The reason:
> "Query failed due to database connection issue: 'Not connected to a database'. Unable to retrieve data from the users table."

The adapter failed to maintain or establish the necessary connection, thus impairing its core function of querying data.

# Join Query Test
Testing join capabilities with `sql_join_tester` similarly failed. The executed INNER JOIN query returned zero rows:
> "Query failed due to database connection issue: 'Not connected to a database'. Unable to retrieve data from the users and orders tables."

Again, a connection failure prevented complex query execution, highlighting a systemic adapter problem affecting joined dataset retrieval.

# Overall Assessment
While database creation was completed successfully with the expected schema, all subsequent adapter tests failed or returned incorrect results. The failures primarily stemmed from the adapters:
- Not identifying existing tables
- Failing to extract table schemas
- Being unable to connect to the database for querying tasks

These issues suggest fundamental problems in database connection management and metadata retrieval within the SQL adapters. To ensure reliable operation, these adapter components require debugging and enhancement, securing stable connections and accurate metadata operations before further testing complex scenarios.

### Recommendations to Improve Customer Relationships Based on SAP Data Context

1. **Upload Core Customer and Sales Data for Targeted Analysis**  
   Since critical datasets like *SalesOrders.csv* and *BusinessPartners.csv* are absent, prioritize collecting and uploading these files. This will enable enriched segmentation, churn analysis, and tailored communication strategies founded on real customer insights.

2. **Leverage SAP Standard Reports to Prepare Customer Profiles**  
   Use existing SAP reports such as the *Customer Sales Report (VC/2)* and *Business Partner Master Data (BP)* to start mapping your customer base and their sales activity. Preliminary profiling will help in designing personalized engagement initiatives once full data is available.

3. **Establish Continuous Data Integration for Ongoing Relationship Management**  
   Develop a process to regularly extract and integrate sales orders, partner data, and supply chain KPIs. This ongoing data flow ensures insights remain current, enabling proactive outreach, personalized offers, and timely resolution of customer issues to strengthen relationships.

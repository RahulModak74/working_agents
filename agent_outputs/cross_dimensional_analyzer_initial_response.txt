  "meta_analysis": "Analysis of all ten dimensions reveals a systemic immaturity in publicly accessible research and authoritative sources on AI's evolving cybersecurity role, despite widespread industry deployments and innovation. The fragmentation of available insights points to an emergent but as yet unmapped interdisciplinary landscape, where AI techniques raise new opportunities and challenges across the offensive-defense continuum, diverse deployment environments, and ethical frontiers. Cross-cutting concerns about agentic AI risks and adversarial threats intersect every dimension, underscoring the necessity for integrated frameworks that marry technical advances with governance, explainability, and human factor considerations. Bridging these gaps will require a combination of foundational empirical mapping, interdisciplinary governance models, and scenario-driven studies utilizing both vendor ecosystems and emerging theoretical frameworks to guide responsible, resilient AI integration in cybersecurity."

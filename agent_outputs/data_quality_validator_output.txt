  "data_issues": [
    "Frequent missing values in the FAXNUMBER column across BusinessPartners section",
    "Potentially inappropriate number formatting (decimals) for IDs like PARTNERID and PHONE fields",
    "Presence of truncated email addresses and web addresses in some entries",
    "Unusual discount values (e.g., high values like 0.9 or 0.83) which may be extreme or input errors",
    "Duplicate or near-duplicate customer names and email addresses in transactional sections",
    "Use of both slash-separated (2018/12/16) and numeric timestamp formats (20181003.00) for dates, reducing uniformity",
    "Some gender fields include invalid or inconsistent entries in customer data",
    "Phone number formats vary; some include dots as decimal, others as strings, risking parsing issues",
    "Product names and supplier details show inconsistent conventions (abbreviated vs full names)",
    "Several contact fields (SupplierContactDetails) appear as social security/ID numbers, not phone numbers"
  ],
  "critical_gaps": [
    "Frequent missing FAXNUMBER indicates systematically incomplete contact info",
    "Inconsistent and mixed date/time formats complicate temporal analyses and ETL processes",
    "Decimals in numeric identifiers (e.g., IDs, phone numbers) can lead to misinterpretation or truncation",
    "No clear unique identifier constraints â€“ duplicates risk skewing business partner analyses",
    "No explicit last update timestamps for some transactional sections, limiting lifecycle auditability or data freshness evaluation"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Standardize date formats across all sections (preferably ISO 8601)",
    "Enforce data types for identifiers and phone/contact numbers as strings to avoid truncation of leading/trailing zeros",
    "Implement mandatory fields for key contact info, especially fax or alternates if fax is obsolete",
    "Regularly validate email and web address formats",
    "Review and set acceptable numeric ranges or outlier detection for financials and discounts",
    "Deduplicate based on critical fields like customer name and email for transactional records",
    "Establish and enforce schema rules on gender fields and other categorical entries",
    "Flag unusually high discount entries for manual review",
    "Introduce explicit versioning or timestamp columns for update tracking",
    "Train data entry teams or vendors to avoid cross-field confusion (e.g., SSNs in phone fields)"

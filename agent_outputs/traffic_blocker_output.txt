### Traffic Blocking Strategy

Based on the security analysis, the following traffic blocking strategy is recommended to mitigate identified threats and vulnerabilities:

---

#### **1. IP Addresses to Block**
- **IP Address:** `192.168.1.254`  
  **Reason:** This IP address exhibited multiple access denied attempts, high request frequency, and access to sensitive endpoints.  
  **Action:** Block this IP address immediately using a firewall or web application firewall (WAF).

---

#### **2. User Agents to Restrict**
- **User Agent:** `Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/121.0.0.0 Safari/537.36`  
  **Reason:** This user agent was associated with suspicious activity, including probing and unauthorized access attempts.  
  **Action:** Add this user agent to a deny list in your WAF or application configuration.

---

#### **3. Rate Limiting Recommendations**
- **Rate Limit:** 10 requests per minute per IP address.  
  **Reason:** The analysis revealed a high frequency of requests in a short timeframe, indicating potential brute force or probing attempts.  
  **Action:** Implement rate limiting using a WAF or API gateway.  
  **Additional Measures:**  
  - Use CAPTCHA for login and sensitive endpoint access.  
  - Implement exponential backoff for repeated failed attempts.

---

#### **4. Endpoint Access Restrictions**
- **Endpoint:** `/api/admin`  
  **Restrictions:**  
  - Allow only `POST` requests.  
  - Restrict access to users with admin roles.  
  **Reason:** Unusual `GET` requests were detected, indicating potential probing.  

- **Endpoint:** `/api/users/45678/reset`  
  **Restrictions:**  
  - Allow only `POST` requests.  
  - Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for access.  
  **Reason:** This endpoint was accessed without proper authorization.  

- **Endpoint:** `/api/users/admin`  
  **Restrictions:**  
  - Allow only `POST` requests.  
  - Restrict access to users with admin roles.  
  **Reason:** Unusual `GET` requests were detected, indicating potential probing.  

---

#### **5. Additional Security Measures**
- **Logging and Monitoring:**  
  - Log all access attempts to sensitive endpoints (`/api/admin`, `/api/users/45678/reset`, `/api/users/admin`).  
  - Set up alerts for repeated 403 status codes or unusual HTTP methods.  

- **Access Controls:**  
  - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive endpoints.  
  - Regularly review and update user permissions.  

- **Session Management:**  
  - Monitor session progression for abnormal patterns (e.g., rapid access to multiple sensitive endpoints).  
  - Implement session timeouts and re-authentication for sensitive actions.  

---

### Implementation Steps
1. **Firewall/WAF Configuration:**  
   - Add `192.168.1.254` to the block list.  
   - Restrict the suspicious user agent.  

2. **Rate Limiting Setup:**  
   - Configure rate limiting rules in your WAF or API gateway.  

3. **Endpoint Access Control:**  
   - Update access control policies for `/api/admin`, `/api/users/45678/reset`, and `/api/users/admin`.  

4. **Logging and Monitoring:**  
   - Enable detailed logging for sensitive endpoints.  
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activity.  

5. **Review and Test:**  
   - Test the implemented rules to ensure they are effective.  
   - Regularly review logs and update rules as needed.

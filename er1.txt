# Traffic Blocking Strategy Based on Security Analysis

To mitigate the identified threats and strengthen the security posture, the following traffic blocking strategy is proposed. This strategy includes IP blocking, user agent restrictions, rate limiting, and endpoint access controls.

---

## **1. IP Addresses to Block**
Based on the analysis, the following IP addresses exhibit suspicious behavior and should be blocked immediately:

- **192.168.1.100**:  
  - **Reason**: Multiple sessions from the same IP, high number of POST requests, and access to sensitive endpoints such as `/login`, `/admin`, and `/user/data`.  
  - **Action**: Block entirely from all endpoints.

- **203.0.113.45**:  
  - **Reason**: Access to admin endpoints using an outdated user agent (`curl/7.64.1`) and unusual timing.  
  - **Action**: Block from accessing `/admin` and `/settings` endpoints.

**Implementation Rule**:  
```plaintext
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.1.100 -j DROP  
iptables -A INPUT -s 203.0.113.45 -j DROP
```

---

## **2. User Agents to Restrict**
The following user agents are associated with suspicious activity and should be restricted:

- **curl/7.64.1**:  
  - **Reason**: Outdated user agent accessing admin and settings endpoints.  
  - **Action**: Block requests from this user agent.

**Implementation Rule**:  
```plaintext
if ($http_user_agent ~* "curl/7.64.1") {  
    return 403;  
}
```

---

## **3. Rate Limiting Recommendations**
To mitigate brute force attacks and unusual request patterns, implement rate limiting on the following endpoints:

- **/login**:  
  - **Threshold**: 10 requests per minute per IP.  
  - **Action**: Block IP temporarily for 5 minutes if the threshold is exceeded.

- **/admin**:  
  - **Threshold**: 5 requests per minute per IP.  
  - **Action**: Block IP temporarily for 10 minutes if the threshold is exceeded.

**Implementation Rule**:  
```plaintext
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=login_limit:10m rate=10r/m;  
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=admin_limit:10m rate=5r/m;  

location /login {  
    limit_req zone=login_limit burst=5 nodelay;  
}  

location /admin {  
    limit_req zone=admin_limit burst=3 nodelay;  
}
```

---

## **4. Endpoint Access Restrictions**
To prevent unauthorized access and privilege escalation, restrict access to critical endpoints:

- **/admin**:  
  - **Allowed IPs**: Whitelist trusted IP addresses (e.g., internal network IPs).  
  - **Allowed User Agents**: Modern browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).  
  - **Action**: Block all other IPs and user agents.

- **/settings**:  
  - **Allowed Methods**: Only `GET` and `POST`.  
  - **Action**: Block `PUT` and other methods.

**Implementation Rule**:  
```plaintext
location /admin {  
    allow 192.168.1.0/24;  
    deny all;  

    if ($http_user_agent !~* "Mozilla|Chrome|Safari|Firefox") {  
        return 403;  
    }  
}  

location /settings {  
    if ($request_method !~ ^(GET|POST)$) {  
        return 405;  
    }  
}
```

---

## **5. Additional Recommendations**
1. **Monitor Temporal Patterns**: Enhance monitoring during peak activity times (12:00 PM and 3:00 PM) for unusual behavior.  
2. **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforce MFA for access to `/login` and `/admin` endpoints.  
3. **Alert on Unusual Timing**: Set up alerts for requests to `/admin` and `/settings` during unusual hours.

This strategy is designed to address the identified threats effectively while minimizing disruption to legitimate users. Regularly review and update the rules based on ongoing monitoring and threat analysis.

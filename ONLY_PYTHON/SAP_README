# SAP Data Analysis Workflow

This Python implementation provides a complete workflow for analyzing SAP data, identifying business optimization opportunities, and creating implementation plans using multiple specialized agents.

## Features

- Comprehensive data analysis of SAP systems
- Data quality assessment and validation
- Industry benchmarking comparison
- Cognitive planning using Tree of Thoughts approach
- Cost-benefit analysis for optimization opportunities
- SAP-specific implementation planning
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Data quality remediation planning
- Implementation validation and testing
- Dynamic implementation approach selection

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- pandas (for data analysis)
- python-docx (optional, for DOCX file processing)
- SQLite (included in Python standard library)
- Access to OpenAI or other LLM API (optional, for enhanced reasoning)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sap-data-workflow.git
cd sap-data-workflow

# Install required dependencies
pip install pandas python-docx requests
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from sap_data_workflow import SAPDataWorkflow

# Create the workflow system
workflow = SAPDataWorkflow()

# Run the analysis
results = workflow.run_analysis('sap_data.csv', 'Sales Reports.docx')

# Access analysis results
print(f"Analysis completed: {results['summary']['analysis_complete']}")
print(f"Selected implementation approach: {results['summary']['selected_implementation_approach']}")
print(f"Results file: {results['results_file']}")
```

### Command Line Usage

```bash
# Run with default filenames
python sap_data_workflow.py

# Run with custom filenames
python sap_data_workflow.py --sap-data path/to/sap_data.csv --sales-reports path/to/reports.docx
```

## Workflow Architecture

The workflow consists of 25+ specialized agents working together in a sequential and parallel manner:

1. **Data Analysis Phase**
   - Data inventory agent
   - Data quality validator
   - Data integrity checker
   - Sales orders analyzer
   - Sales order items analyzer
   - Business partners analyzer
   - Supply chain analyzer

2. **Contextual Analysis Phase**
   - Industry benchmark researcher
   - Benchmarked analysis integrator
   - Reports document analyzer
   - Business challenge framer

3. **Cognitive Planning Phase**
   - Cognitive pattern explorer
   - Cognitive session creator
   - Tree of Thoughts workflow navigator
   - Cognitive results transformer

4. **Implementation Planning Phase**
   - Cost-benefit analyzer
   - SAP implementation specialist
   - Data quality remediation planner
   - Implementation risk analyzer
   - Dynamic implementation selector

5. **Validation and Reporting Phase**
   - Implementation reliability tester
   - Implementation validator
   - Comprehensive report creator

## Sample Output

The system generates several outputs:

1. **Analysis Results JSON** - Complete results from all agents
2. **Analysis Report Markdown** - Comprehensive report with sections:
   - Executive Summary
   - SAP Data Analysis Overview
   - Data Quality Assessment
   - Industry Benchmark Comparison
   - Business Challenges & Opportunities
   - Strategic Optimization Plan
   - SAP-Specific Implementation Details
   - Implementation Roadmap
   - Data Quality Remediation Plan
   - Risk Management
   - Expected Business Outcomes

## Extending the Framework

### Adding New Data Analysis Tools

```python
def my_custom_analysis(data: Dict[str, Any], context: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Implement your custom analysis
    result = {...}
    return result

# Register the tool
ToolRegistry.register_tool("custom:my_analysis", my_custom_analysis)
```

### Creating Custom Agents

```python
# Add a custom agent to the workflow
workflow.add_agent(Agent(
    agent_id="my_custom_agent",
    content="Perform custom analysis on the SAP data",
    tools=["custom:my_analysis"],
    read_from=["data_inventory_agent", "data_quality_validator"],
    output_format={
        "type": "json",
        "schema": {
            "custom_insights": ["string"],
            "recommendations": ["string"]
        }
    }
))
```

## Configuration

The system uses a configuration file (`config.py`) with settings for:

- Output directories
- LLM API settings
- Database locations
- Memory storage settings

## Limitations

- The current implementation uses simulated data for some aspects
- Real implementation would require connection to actual SAP systems via APIs
- Industry benchmarks are simulated and would need real data sources
- LLM integration requires valid API keys and credits
